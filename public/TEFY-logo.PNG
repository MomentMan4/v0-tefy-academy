// This is a placeholder for the TEFY-logo.PNG image file.
// In a real application, this file would contain the actual image data.
// Since we cannot directly represent an image file in text, we provide this placeholder.
// The application expects this file to exist and be a valid image.
// You would typically place the actual TEFY-logo.PNG file in the public directory.
